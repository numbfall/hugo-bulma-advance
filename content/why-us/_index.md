### Why Us?

With the number of educational institutes on the rise, the scarcity of qualified and trained educators that are able to effectively fulfill the fundamental role of teachers as mentors for their students as well as cater to their spiritual and social grooming, is being direly felt by school managers. Keeping in mind this disparity, the establishment of a training facility that caters to fill this gap seemed essential, and hence the inception of *A D V A N C E* **consultancy**.

### Testimonials

> The information was prepared very well and was very balanced. All aspects of teaching and learning were covered beautifully during the course.

> I have already taken a lot of teacher trainings before and have conducted some as well in the past, but this platform has a special frequency of positive energy that creates an exceptional harmony in the environment.

> A nice thing observed was that all the qualities that the trainer wanted us to learn as a teacher (manners etc.) were also present in her personality. Thatâ€™s really amazing!

> Had a great time here! Teaching methodology of the trainer outstands the most. She made the classroom environment very lively. I liked how this course was related to Islam as well, because in this way we got to learn about the beautiful integration between the world and our religion.
